# Predikan
This is a WordPress plugin. Upload sermons to your church’s website as a podcast and include them, in a table, on any of your pages.

## Installation
This plugin should only be installed through the WordPress plugin manager. See [its page on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/predikan/) for more information.

## Release checklist
Document all changes contiuosly in [readme.txt](src/readme.txt) under the _Changelog_ heading. This section should hold the latest minor release and its patches ([semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)).

- [ ] Copy the current release’s changelog from [readme.txt](src/readme.txt) to [changelog.txt](src/changelog.txt).
- [ ] Condense that into one sentence that explains why site admins should update to this version. This should be posted in [upgrade_notices.txt](src/upgrade_notices.txt).

Mark the current version of the repository as a new release and GutHub actions should post it to WordPress.org when it feels like doing it. The release name and tag label must only be the version number.
